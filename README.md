This is an Android sample project.

The project's skeleton is Kotlin , RxJava and RxAndroid. Kotlin is a new programming lauguage that runs on the java virtual machine. Kotlin is designed to interoerate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing jar or aar.   RxJava is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM.

To design a clean, testable, reusable and expandable project, I also import MVP pattern. MVP is a user interface architectural pattern engineered to facilitate automated unit testing and improve the separation of concerns in presentation logic.
